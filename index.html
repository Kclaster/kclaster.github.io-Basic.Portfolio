                        Hi, my name is Kyle. I am a father of three, a husband of six years, active in church. And I sing backstreet boys in the shower. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        My family and I live on two acres in a little log-cabin in southern Fort Worth. When I get a moment to myself I love to read everything from children books like Redwall or Harry Potter to the latest Stephan King book. On top of reading I am an aspiring author and attend a yearly writing conference to push my book titled "Walls" a YA thriller.

                        I am terrified of heights and while attending the University of Arkansas I took it upon myself to break that fear by rock climbing monthly. Up until I became a father I held to that promise. I am still terrified of heights; I cannot stand ontop of my car without my knees trembling... I am, however, a decent rock climber (the secret is to sing banana pancakes by Jack Johnson when you get scared).
